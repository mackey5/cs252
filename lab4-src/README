1.5: printC is in an infinit loop, and the threads are called after the function call. Therefore, the threads never get called, and it will always print "C".


 							System  (Kernel) Time  	User Time 	Real Time
	pthread_mutex (count) 	  	  	 	1.68			1.38		1.56		
	spin lock (count_spin with thr_yield) 	  	.12  	 		.38 		.28
	spin_lock (count_spin without thr_yield)  	0			1.88		.99 

3.1: When thr_yield is not called, all of the program is executed in User mode, thus increasing the amount of time it takes. System mode is only used when thr_yiled is called.
Spin locks give up the CPU, and mutex locks do not. Therefore, the system time is less in a spin lock than a mutex lock.
